This file will walk you through building and running the eBPF mutator. The 
mutator operates on eBPF bytecode objects named "prog.bpf.o".


BUILD:

- Simply call make

    $ make


RUN:

Follow the instructions in README2 to understand how to interpret the 
output of the mutator. For the sake of immediate testing, an object file 
containing the sys_enter_getdents64 eBPF program bytecode is included in 
this directory. 

- To execute the mutator, simply run it:

    $ ./mutator
